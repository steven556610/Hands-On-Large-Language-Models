    "# Text to summarize which we stole from https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/ ;)\n",
    "text = \"\"\"In the previous post, we looked at Attention – a ubiquitous method in modern deep learning models. Attention is a concept that helped improve the performance of neural machine translation applications. In this post, we will look at The Transformer – a model that uses attention to boost the speed with which these models can be trained. The Transformer outperforms the Google Neural Machine Translation model in specific tasks. The biggest benefit, however, comes from how The Transformer lends itself to parallelization. It is in fact Google Cloud’s recommendation to use The Transformer as a reference model to use their Cloud TPU offering. So let’s try to break the model apart and look at how it functions.\n",
    "The Transformer was proposed in the paper Attention is All You Need. A TensorFlow implementation of it is available as a part of the Tensor2Tensor package. Harvard’s NLP group created a guide annotating the paper with PyTorch implementation. In this post, we will attempt to oversimplify things a bit and introduce the concepts one by one to hopefully make it easier to understand to people without in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.\n",
    "Let’s begin by looking at the model as a single black box. In a machine translation application, it would take a sentence in one language, and output its translation in another.\n",
    "Popping open that Optimus Prime goodness, we see an encoding component, a decoding component, and connections between them.\n",
    "The encoding component is a stack of encoders (the paper stacks six of them on top of each other – there’s nothing magical about the number six, one can definitely experiment with other arrangements). The decoding component is a stack of decoders of the same number.\n",
    "The encoders are all identical in structure (yet they do not share weights). Each one is broken down into two sub-layers:\n",
    "The encoder’s inputs first flow through a self-attention layer – a layer that helps the encoder look at other words in the input sentence as it encodes a specific word. We’ll look closer at self-attention later in the post.\n",
    "The outputs of the self-attention layer are fed to a feed-forward neural network. The exact same feed-forward network is independently applied to each position.\n",
    "The decoder has both those layers, but between them is an attention layer that helps the decoder focus on relevant parts of the input sentence (similar what attention does in seq2seq models).\n",
    "Now that we’ve seen the major components of the model, let’s start to look at the various vectors/tensors and how they flow between these components to turn the input of a trained model into an output.\n",
    "As is the case in NLP applications in general, we begin by turning each input word into a vector using an embedding algorithm.\n",
    "Each word is embedded into a vector of size 512. We'll represent those vectors with these simple boxes.\n",
    "The embedding only happens in the bottom-most encoder. The abstraction that is common to all the encoders is that they receive a list of vectors each of the size 512 – In the bottom encoder that would be the word embeddings, but in other encoders, it would be the output of the encoder that’s directly below. The size of this list is hyperparameter we can set – basically it would be the length of the longest sentence in our training dataset.\n",
    "After embedding the words in our input sequence, each of them flows through each of the two layers of the encoder.\n",
    "Here we begin to see one key property of the Transformer, which is that the word in each position flows through its own path in the encoder. There are dependencies between these paths in the self-attention layer. The feed-forward layer does not have those dependencies, however, and thus the various paths can be executed in parallel while flowing through the feed-forward layer.\n",
    "Next, we’ll switch up the example to a shorter sentence and we’ll look at what happens in each sub-layer of the encoder.\n",
    "Now We’re Encoding!\n",
    "As we’ve mentioned already, an encoder receives a list of vectors as input. It processes this list by passing these vectors into a ‘self-attention’ layer, then into a feed-forward neural network, then sends out the output upwards to the next encoder.\n",

      "The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of how the size of pre-training data affects the performance of Large Language Models. It demonstrates that while larger datasets lead to better model performance, there is a threshold beyond which additional data does not significantly enhance the model's capabilities. This finding is crucial for researchers and practitioners in the field, as it highlights the importance of data optimization and the need to balance the benefits of extensive data with the practical limitations of computational resources and data quality. The study also raises awareness of the potential biases that can be introduced through large-scale data collection, suggesting that future advancements should consider these factors to develop more robust and fair LLMs.\n"

    "\n",

    "## 零樣本與少樣本的關係 (Relationship between Zero-shot and Few-shot)\n",
    "\n",
    "零樣本和少樣本 (以及單樣本 One-shot) 都屬於一種稱為**情境學習 (In-Context Learning)** 的提示工程技術。它們的共同點是透過精心設計的**提示詞 (prompt)** 來**引導**生成模型產生所需的回答或遵循指令，而**無需更新或重新訓練模型本身的權重**。\n",
    "\n",
    "它們之間的關係主要取決於在提示詞中提供了多少**範例 (examples)**：\n",
    "\n",
    "| 概念 | 範例數量 (在提示詞中) | 目的 | 來源 |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **零樣本 (Zero-shot)** | **零**（不提供任何範例） | 模型僅依賴**指令**或**提示詞本身**來回答。 | |\n",
    "| **單樣本 (One-shot)** | **一個**範例 | 提供一個正確範例，以指導模型理解預期的**格式**或**風格**。 | |\n",
    "| **少樣本 (Few-shot)** | **兩個或更多**範例 | 提供多個正確範例，以提升模型輸出的**品質、結構**和**一致性**。 | |\n",
    "\n",
    "**關係總結：** 少樣本提示和零樣本提示都是**情境學習**的不同形式，用來告知模型「應該達成什麼目標」以及「如何達成」。單樣本是少樣本（使用兩個或更多範例）的一種特殊情況。\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 與零樣本、少樣本相似的可比較概念\n",
    "\n",
    "有幾個概念與零樣本/少樣本提示密切相關，並可用於區分 LLM 在不同任務上的能力：\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. 情境學習 (In-Context Learning)\n",
    "\n",
    "情境學習是一個**涵蓋性概念**，用來描述透過在輸入提示詞中提供範例來指導模型預期行為的能力。\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **關係：** 零樣本、單樣本和少樣本都是**情境學習**的實踐方式。情境學習的優勢在於它能讓模型在**無需更新權重**的情況下，將預期的行為或格式傳授給模型。\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. 指令式提示 (Instruction-Based Prompting)\n",
    "\n",
    "指令式提示是一種更廣泛的類別，重點在於讓 LLM 遵循特定的**指示 (Instruction)** 來解決問題或完成任務。\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **關係：** 零樣本提示和少樣本提示都是執行**指令式提示**的方式。例如，無論有無範例，要求模型「將句子分類為正面或負面」就是一種指令式提示。\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. 思維鏈 (Chain-of-Thought, CoT)\n",
    "\n",
    "思維鏈是一種進階的提示技巧，旨在讓模型在給出最終答案前，先展示其**逐步的推理過程**。這模仿了人類的「系統 2 思考」模式（有意識、緩慢、邏輯的過程）。\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Zero-shot CoT (零樣本思維鏈)：** 這是零樣本概念與思維鏈概念的結合。它**不需要範例**，只需在提示詞末尾加上一句話，例如「**Let's think step-by-step.**」（讓我們一步一步思考）來引導模型產生推理過程。\n",
    "    *   **與 Zero-shot 的比較：** 零樣本提示（Zero-shot Prompting）僅依賴指令得到答案，而零樣本思維鏈（Zero-shot CoT）則依賴指令加上**引導推理的短語**來提高複雜問題（例如數學問題）的準確性。\n",
    "*   **Few-shot CoT (少樣本思維鏈)：** 在提示詞中提供包含**逐步推理過程**的範例，以教會模型如何進行邏輯計算。\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. 監督式分類 (Supervised Classification)\n",
    "\n",
    "監督式分類是傳統機器學習方法，需要模型透過**大量已標註的訓練數據**來學習特定任務（例如文本分類），並且通常涉及模型的**微調 (fine-tuning)**。\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **與 Zero-shot/Few-shot 的比較：**\n",
    "    *   **目標：** 監督式分類的目標是透過修改模型權重來達到最佳性能，而零樣本/少樣本的目標是**在不修改模型權重**的前提下，通過提示詞來利用模型的通用知識。\n",
    "    *   **數據需求：** 監督式分類需要大量標註數據；而少樣本分類僅需**少量標註數據** (Few-shot classification)，零樣本分類則**完全不需要標註數據** (Zero-shot classification)。\n",
    "    *   **應用：** 在資源密集度較高（如計算資源或標註數據）的情況下，零樣本和少樣本技術提供了無需昂貴微調即可解決任務的**靈活性**。\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. 少樣本分類框架 (SetFit)\n",
    "\n",
    "SetFit 是一種用於執行少樣本文本分類的**框架**，儘管它利用了「少樣本」的數據限制，但其底層實現涉及模型**微調 (fine-tuning)**。\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **與 Few-shot Prompting 的比較：**\n",
    "    *   **Few-shot Prompting** 是一種**推論 (inference)** 時的技術，僅通過提示詞中的範例指導生成。\n",
    "    *   **SetFit** 則是一個**訓練 (training)** 框架，它利用少量標註數據生成正/負樣本對，然後通過**對比學習 (contrastive learning)** 來微調預訓練的嵌入模型，從而優化分類任務。雖然 SetFit 在少數範例下表現優異 (例如僅用 32 個標註文檔就達到了 F1 分數 0.85)，但它改變了模型的權重。SetFit 也支援透過標籤名稱生成合成範例來進行零樣本分類。"
